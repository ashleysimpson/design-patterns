# Design Patterns

This repo is just a collection of design patterns that I wanted to write in Typescript for practice.

If anyone finds these useful feel free to look through them. And if you find an issue also feel free to comment.

Inspiration was taken from: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans.
